<h1>About the Charity Chain Experiment</h1>

<p>The Charity Chain Experiment (CCE) was conceived by Eric Schnarr for a
  leadership challenge assignment, part of a recent management training
  course. The assignment was to take $100 start-up capital, and generate a
  greater value of good deeds for the community and the world. So I invested
  some capital in a domain name and other virtual supplies, and enlisted the
  help of friends to develop this site.</p>

<p>The site's purpose is to encourage people to make charitable donations now,
  rather than waiting for later, or not donating at all. It's not specific:
  There are many good charities out there that need support. This site simply
  connects people to worthy charities. Then like a chain letter, it's
  membership grows expoentially.</p>

<p>We ask people to tell us how much they've donated, so we can show the total
  value of charitable donations generated. Visit this site again later to see
  how the total grows. Like my management training course, this experiment ends
  in April, after which it will stop growing and recording new donations.</p>

<p>Thank your for your support,<br>—Eric Schnarr, CCE Inventor</p>
